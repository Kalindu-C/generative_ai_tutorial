Machine learning is a branch of AI that trains computers to learn and improve from data and examples. Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence where a machine learns from past experiences (input data) and makes future predictions. It's typically divided into three categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning.\"\u001b[0m\u001b[33;1m\u001b[1;3m119\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mI now know the final answer\n",
